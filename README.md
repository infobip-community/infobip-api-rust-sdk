# Infobip API Rust SDK

[![Licence](https://img.shields.io/github/license/infobip-community/infobip-api-rust-sdk)](LICENSE-MIT)

Client SDK to use the Infobip API with pure Rust.

This library enables you to use multiple Infobip communication channels, like SMS, MMS,
Whatsapp, Email, etc. It abstracts the needed HTTP calls, and models payloads and error
handling. The module structure is divided by communication channel.

---

## üì° Supported Channels
- [SMS](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/sms) (in progress)

More Channels to be added in the near future!

## üîê Authentication
To use the library, you'll need to set up an Infobip account. Then you can use your API Key and
custom URL to call the endpoints. You can use the `Configuration::from_env_api_key()` method to
load the configuration from the environment. To do that, export the variables `IB_API_KEY` and
`IB_BASE_URL`.

## üì¶ Installation
To use the library, add the dependency to your projects `Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
infobip-sdk = "0.1"
```

## üöÄ Usage
To use the library, import the client and channel-specific models. Then create a client and
call the associated functions. For example, te send an SMS, you can do this:
```rust
use infobip_sdk::model::sms::{DestinationBuilder, MessageBuilder, SendRequestBodyBuilder};
use infobip_sdk::api::sms::SmsClient;
use infobip_sdk::configuration::Configuration;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Build SMS client with configuration from the environment.
    let sms_client = SmsClient::with_configuration(
        // Load IB_API_KEY and IB_BASE_URL environment variables.
        Configuration::from_env_api_key().unwrap()
    );

    // Build a Destination instance.
    let destination = DestinationBuilder::default()
        .to("123456789012".to_string())
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    // Build a Message instance.
    let message = MessageBuilder::default()
        .destinations(vec![destination])
        .text("Your message text".to_string())
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    // Build the SendRequestBody instance.
    let request_body = SendRequestBodyBuilder::default()
        .messages(vec![message])
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    // Send the SMS.
    let response = sms_client.send(request_body).await.unwrap();

    // Do what you want with the response.
    assert_eq!(response.status, reqwest::StatusCode::OK);
    println!("{:?}", response.response_body);
}
```

## üëÄ Examples
The best way to learn how to use the library is to look at the official docs.rs documentation.
You can also look at integration tests under the [tests](./tests) directory, which work as you
would use them in a real scenario.

## ‚Ñπ Notes

### Using features
You can speed up compile-times a bit by turning only the needed channels as library features.
For example, to only build SMS, add the dependency like this:
```toml
infobip-sdk = { version = "0.1", features = ["sms"] }
```
You can see the complete list of features in the Cargo.toml of the project. Feature names
follow channel names.

### Building payload models
Structs that represent the models have public fields, so you can either build them with the
provided Builders, or by calling the true constructor.
